        selector {
            property1: value1;
            property2: value2;
            /* More property and values */

        1. Selector: Specifies which HTML elements the CSS rules should apply to.
        Selectors can be based on element names, classes, IDS, attributes or combinations
        thereof

        2. Property: Defines the aspect of the selected elements that you want to style, 
        such as "color", "font-size", "margin" etc

        3. Value: Specifies the value for the property, such as "red" for the "color"
        property or "20px" for the "Font-size" property.

        4. Declaration Block: Enclosed within curly braces{} and contains more property-value pairs.
