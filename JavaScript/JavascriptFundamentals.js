//Variables - Are named memory Locations for data
            //To create a variable in Javascript we use the keyword 'LET'...Example Below

let message;//This statement creates a variable with the name message.
message = "Hello World"; //the message variable stores the string "Hello World"

alert(message);

let name = "Joe";

let fname = "Joe", age = "34", msg = "Hello";

//Ruled of Declaring Variables

    //1. Always start with the key word
    //2. Never declare two variables using the same name
    //3. The name must contain letters, digits or the symbols $ and _.
    //4. Always start with alphabet characters/ the first character must not be a digit.
    //5. Do not use numbers to name your variables
    //6. After declaring a variable do not forget to terminate (;)
    //7. After initializing a variable do not forget to terminate (;)
    //8. When the name contains multiple words always use camelCase
    //example of camelCase - firstName
    //9. Case matters name and Name are two different variables. Always ensure to check on your case
    //10. Avoid using reserved or key words eg let
    //11. If you want to have a variable that does not change, declare the variable using keyword 'const'
    //e.g const pi = 3.142

//Summary
//We can declare varibles to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.

//let - is a modern variable declaration.
//var - is an old school variable declaration. Normally we don't use it at all, but well cover subtle differences
//const - is like let, but the value of the variable can't be changed.
//Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what's inside them.


//Task

//Assign values to the declared variables
