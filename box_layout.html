    <!-- The Box model and layout in css -->
    <!-- The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are rendered in web pages.
        It consists of four components : content,padding,border and margin. Understanding the box model is
        essential for creating layouts and controlling the spacing around elements. Let's explore the 4 components:
        
        ->:1. Content
                ->: The content area contain actul content of the element.
                ->: You can control its size using the width and height properties.

        ->:2. Padding:
                ->:Padding is the space between the content and the element's border.
                ->:You can set padding using the padding property or individually with padding-top,
                padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left.

        ->:3. Border:
                ->:The border surrounds the content and padding.
                ->:You can define its style, width and color using the border property.

        ->:4. Margin
                ->:Margins create space outside the elements border.
                ->:You can set margins using the margin property or individually with margin-top,
